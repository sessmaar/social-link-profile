### Links

## My process

I recently watched a course on best practices on CSS and responsive websites. I tried to apply as much of the information I learned as possible.

Also I started adding more comments on my css process to review it down the road and compare my approach once I have practiced a lot of different methods.

In this case I used more rems units than I have used before and tried to be as close to the original desing as possible while making the whole thing responsive.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned to use semantic element on my css to be more friendly and use rems measuraments to have a more responsive design.
